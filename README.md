# elastic-proxy-server

A middleware to demonstrate how to secure elastic using a simple Node/Express server. Here I'm using [`http-proxy-middleware`](https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware) for brevity however the logic can be extended easily with express based routing.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repo with `git clone`
2. Install dependencies with `yarn`
3. Run the server with `yarn start`
